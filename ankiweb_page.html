<a href="https://activitywatch.net/">ActivityWatch</a> watcher for Anki.

Currently the add-on monitors reviews and sends the following types of data to ActivityWatch: the card ID, note ID, and deck name.
You can view your Anki activity in ActivityWatch's Web interface by going to the <i>Raw Data</i> section and opening the bucket that has a name starting with <i>anki-watcher</i>.
I may extend the add-on to monitor more types of events in the future (e.g. how much time the user spends adding/editing cards)
