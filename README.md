[ActivityWatch](https://activitywatch.net/) watcher for Anki implemented as an Anki add-on.

Currently the add-on monitors reviews and sends the following types of data to ActivityWatch: the card ID, note ID, and deck name.

You can view your Anki activity in ActivityWatch's Web interface by going to the _Raw Data_ section and opening the bucket that has a name starting with _anki-watcher_.

I may extend the add-on to monitor more types of events in the future (e.g. how much time the user spends adding/editing cards)
